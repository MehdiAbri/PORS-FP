### Example
```bash
spx-fp report --n 16 --w 16 --h 22 --d 4 --t 524288 --k 13 --q 1024 --m-max 20


âœ… Explanation:
- The first line starts the fenced code block: ```` ```bash ````  
- The command is inside the block.  
- The closing line ```` ``` ```` ends the block.  
- Then you can write any normal Markdown text underneath.

### ðŸ’¡ Tip:
If you forget to close the block before your text, everything below will still render as part of the code â€” so always make sure you add the closing triple backticks first.
